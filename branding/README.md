The style guide is now complete, revised based our initial experience and feedback. It includes sections on fonts, colors, sub-brands, distinct brands, color use and cartography, and application of OSGeo branding elements to evertyhing from banners to buisness cards.

# Logos

Logos are as provided for OSGeo and sub-brands (all of which include the unalterned OSGeo mark). Distinct brands (such as GeoForAll and OSGeo Live) maintain their own mark.

While logos have been produced with Miriam Libre Bold and Sintony Regular the resulting shapes have been reduced to outlines for use on systems that do not have the correct fonts available. A template has been provided for the generation of additional sub-brand logos.
